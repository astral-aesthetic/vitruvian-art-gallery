- Optimizes canvas display

**Complete Code**:
```css
body {
    margin: 0;
    overflow: hidden; /* Hide scrollbars */
    background-color: #000;
}

canvas {
    display: block; /* Remove extra space below canvas */
}
```

#### 3. main.js
**Purpose**: Core application logic implementing the 3D gallery

**Key Implementation Details**:

##### Environment Setup
- **Gallery Dimensions**: 20x20 meter square hall with 6-meter wall height
- **Physics**: Earth-like gravity (-9.82 m/sÂ²)
- **Player**: First-person character with realistic physics (70kg mass, 0.5m radius)

##### Lighting System
- **Ambient Light**: Subtle base illumination (0.15 intensity)
- **Directional Light**: Minimal external lighting (0.05 intensity)
- **Gallery Spotlights**: 12 warm white spotlights strategically positioned
  - 3 spotlights per wall for optimal artwork illumination
  - Warm white color (0xffeedd) with soft edges
  - Physical light decay simulation
- **Central Ceiling Light**: Point light for overall ambiance

##### Materials and Textures
- **Floor**: Wood planks texture from Polyhaven CDN with 10x tiling
- **Walls**: Black standard material (0xcccccc)
- **Ceiling**: Very dark black (0x050505)
- **Bench**: Gold metal-like material (0x5A5A5A)

##### Gallery Features
- **Central Bench**: Large scaled seating in gallery center
- **Wall Structure**: Four walls with proper physics collision
- **Ceiling**: Complete overhead coverage
- **Artwork Display**: 12 artwork slots (3 per wall)

##### Player Controls
- **Movement**: WASD keys for directional movement
- **Look**: Mouse look with pointer lock
- **Jump**: Spacebar with ground detection
- **Physics**: Realistic collision detection and jumping mechanics

##### Artwork System
- **Dynamic Loading**: Images loaded asynchronously from local directory
- **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Automatic width calculation based on standard height
- **Error Handling**: Fallback placeholders for failed image loads
- **Positioning**: Strategic placement at eye level on all four walls

### 4. images/ Directory
**Purpose**: Contains artwork assets for gallery display

**Available Artworks**:
- artwork1.jpg through artwork12.jpg
- 12 total images corresponding to the 12 display positions in the gallery
- Images are referenced in main.js and loaded dynamically
