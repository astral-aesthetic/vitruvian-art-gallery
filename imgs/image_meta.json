The large oil on canvas depicts the Infanta Margaret Theresa surrounded by her attendants, a majestic dog, two dwarfs, and Velázquez himself, who is seen painting at an easel in a room in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid. Behind them, a mirror reflects King Philip IV and Queen Mariana, whose implied presence is central to the scene. This complex composition is celebrated for its intricate play of illusion, reality, and the artist's role, making it one of the most analyzed works in Western art history. The painting is a cornerstone of the Prado Museum collection in Madrid.",
