{"extracted_information": "The project '3D Art Gallery Online' is an online 3D art gallery. It utilizes Three.js for 3D rendering and Cannon.js for physics simulation. The project structure comprises `index.html` (main HTML), `main.js` (JavaScript logic for Three.js and Cannon.js), `style.css` (basic styling), `README.md`, and an `images` folder. Dependencies, Three.js and Cannon.js, are loaded via CDN, eliminating the need for local installation. The primary technologies used are JavaScript (97.6%), HTML (1.8%), and CSS (0.6%). To run the project, a modern web browser supporting WebGL is required; execution involves simply opening the `index.html` file. The last recorded commit for the project was on June 10, 2025.", "specifications": {"execution_environment": "Modern web browser with WebGL support", "dependency_loading_method": "CDN (Content Delivery Network)"}, "pricing": {}, "features": ["Online 3D art gallery functionality", "3D rendering using Three.js", "Physics simulation using Cannon.js"], "statistics": {"language_breakdown": {"JavaScript": "97.6%", "HTML": "1.8%", "CSS": "0.6%"}}, "temporal_info": {"last_commit_date": "Jun 10, 2025"}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": [{"name": "Three.js", "url": "https://threejs.org/"}, {"name": "Cannon.js", "url": "https://schteppe.github.io/cannon.js/"}]}
